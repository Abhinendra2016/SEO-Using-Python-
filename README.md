## SEO Automation Using API

### Benefits of the Web Search Indexing API

The Indexing API allows site owners to notify Google when they add or remove pages from their site, or update content at a previously-submitted URL. This can help Google schedule pages for a fresh crawl, which can lead to higher quality user traffic and improved search visibility.

Each project is designed to save time and provide valuable insights to improve your SEO efforts.
